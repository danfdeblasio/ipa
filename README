This is an updated version of Kim and Kececioglu's algorithm for inverse parametric alignment (see http://inversealign.cs.arizona.edu for information). Modifications needed to be made in order to compile correctly. 

Currently as implemented, this version requires GLPK 4.57 or *earlier*. They changed the API and removed the commands that are needed for the *old* old API conversion scripts (`lpx.*`) to work. The version I used can be found at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.57.tar.gz.
