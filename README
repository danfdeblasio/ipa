This is an updated version of Kim and Kececioglu's algorithm for inverse parametric alignment (see http://inversealign.cs.arizona.edu for information). Modifications needed to be made in order to compile correctly. 

Currently as implemented, this version requires GLPK 4.9 or later. They changed the API, and the conversion scripts (`lpx.*`) are needed to get this version to compile. The version I used can be found at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.65.tar.gz.
